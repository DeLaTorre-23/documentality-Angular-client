# DocumentalityAngularClient

This application is build in a single-page using Angular that is connected to the Documentality backend. Users are able to create an account and browse their favorite documentaries. They can modify account information, add or remove documentaries from their list of favorites, or delete their account.

This app is built using the MEAN stack of technologies, (MongoDB, Angular, Express.js, Node.js). The app uses Angular Material throughout as well.

A key feature that distinguishes this client from the [React Client](https://https://github.com/DeLaTorre-23/Documentality-Client/) is that the user is able to toggle between light mode and dark mode with a button on the navigation bar.
